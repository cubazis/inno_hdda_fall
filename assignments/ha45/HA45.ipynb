    "Assume we have a text corpus given as a sequence of words $\\{w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_n\\}$ where $n$ may be larger than $10^{12}$ and $w_i \\in \\mathcal{V}$ belongs to a vocabulary of words $\\mathcal{V}$. A word $c \\in \\mathcal{V}$ is called *a context* of word $w_i$ if they are found together in the text. More formally, given some measure $L$ of closeness between two words (typical choice is $L=2$), a word $c \\in \\mathcal{V}$ is called a context if $c \\in \\{w_{i-L}, \\dots, w_{i-1}, w_{i+1}, \\dots, w_{i+L} \\}$ Let $\\mathbf{w},\\mathbf{c}\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ be the *word embeddings* of word $w$ and context $c$, respectively. Assume they are specified by the mapping  $\\Phi:\\mathcal{V}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^d$, so $\\mathbf{w}=\\Phi(w)$. The ultimate goal of SGNS word embedding model is to fit a good mapping $\\Phi$.\n",

    "###### 3. Matrix factorization problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $|\\mathcal{V}|=m$, $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}$ and $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}$ be matrices, where each row $\\mathbf{w}\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ of matrix $W$ is the word embedding of the corresponding word $w$ and each row $\\mathbf{c}\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ of matrix $C$ is the context embedding of the corresponding context $c$. SGNS embeds both words and their contexts into a low-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^d$, resulting in the word and context matrices $W$ and $C$. The rows of matrix $W$ are typically used in NLP tasks (such as computing word similarities) while $C$ is ignored. It is nonetheless instructive to consider the product $W^\\top C = M$. Viewed this way, SGNS can be described as factorizing an implicit matrix $M$ of dimensions $m \\times m$ into two smaller matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which matrix is being factorized? A matrix entry $M_{wc}$ corresponds to the dot product $\\mathbf{w}^\\top\\mathbf{c}$ . Thus, SGNS is factorizing a matrix in which each row corresponds to a word $w \\in \\mathcal{V}$ , each column corresponds to a context $c \\in \\mathcal{V}$, and each cell contains a quantity $f(w,c)$ reflecting the strength of association between that particular word-context pair. Such word-context association matrices are very common in the NLP and word-similarity literature. That said, the objective of SGNS does not explicitly state what this association metric is. What can we say about the association function $f(w,c)$? In other words, which matrix is SGNS factorizing? Below you will find the answers."
